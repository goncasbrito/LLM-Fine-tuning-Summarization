Bush praised the U.S. relationship with South Korea on Wednesday and said the two nations should continue to work together to eliminate threats from North Korea. President George W. Bush and South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak attend a joint press conference in Seoul. Bush spoke during a news conference with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak. The stop in South Korea is part of Bush's weeklong Asian tour. \\\"Our relationship is important vital and I believe it is strong,\\\" Bush said. Bush said he was still concerned about North Korea and said the country has a long way to go before it is taken off his \\\"axis of evil list\\\" as well as removing it from a list of countries that sponsor terrorism. \\\"I am concerned about North Korea's human rights record,\\\" Bush said \\\"I am concerned about the uranium enrichment...\\\" He spoke hours after thousands of protesters packed the streets of the South Korean capital Tuesday.  Watch Bush speak on his hopes for his \\\"axis of evil\\\" list \\u00bb . While some demonstrations were peaceful, violence erupted at other protest sites. In one instance, riot police fired a water cannon to keep the crowds at bay. Police said they detained about 80 protesters. They estimated about 2,700 people were participating in the protests, which included a candlelight march and a sit-in. But the organizers said some 10,000 were taking part in the demonstrations. Bush's weeklong trip to the region is his ninth visit as president.  See a map of Bush's itinerary \\u00bb . His stop in Seoul comes just a few months after violent street protests erupted over worries about the safety of U.S. beef imports. While those tensions seem to have eased, the United States' nuclear disarmament deal with North Korea is also a concern. Michael Green, a former Bush adviser on Asian affairs, and now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says Seoul's proximity to North Korea contributes to an ongoing unease. \\\"The North Koreans have 11,000 artillery tubes and rockets aimed at the South Korean capital, so any little thing that we do with North Korea makes the South Koreans very jittery,\\\" Green said. He added, \\\"On the other hand, the U.S. has to worry a great deal about where terrorists might get nuclear weapons or nuclear material.\\\" After South Korea, the president will go to Thailand for what's being billed as a major Asia policy speech before making his way to Beijing, China, for the Olympics.

'12 Days of Cantona' can often be heard at Old Trafford at this time of year, and BT have done their best to outdo the United faithful. Chelsea were the club lucky enough to be selected to play a part in their version of 'Jingle Bells', with the singers keen to see the Blues win away from Stamford Bridge. VIDEO Scroll down for the full version of this advert . Carol singers put their own take on some famous songs heard reverberating around Premier League grounds . Not quite expecting the subject of the carols to be football, the homeowner duly listens to the singers perform . The singers turn their backs to put their own take on Lech Poznan's famous goal celebration . The ringleader orchestrates his fellow singers as they break into full voice . Songs such as 'Where were you when you were s***' also add to the light-hearted nature of the spoof. The 'Poznan' celebration also makes an appearance. This phenomenon was made famous after Polish outfit Lech Poznan visited Manchester City in 2013, with their fans celebrating a goal by turning their backs to pitch and jumping up and down. Other racier numbers include 'My old man', which is also often heard around the red half of Manchester.\",\n          \"Vero Beach, Florida (CNN) -- Kaitlyn Hunt, the 19-year-old who has been jailed in Florida over a sexual relationship she had with a 14-year-old girl, pleaded no contest Thursday to five charges as part of a deal brokered by prosecutors and her attorneys. Hunt pleaded no contest to two counts of misdemeanor battery, misdemeanor contributing to the dependency of a child and two counts of felony interference with child custody. Hunt has been in jail since August 20 for violating a court order not to contact the alleged victim. Under the terms of the agreement, Hunt will be sentenced to four months in jail, to be followed by two years of house arrest with electronic monitoring, and nine months of monitored probation after that, according to prosecutor Brian Workman. If she has no violations, she will not be a convicted felon under Florida law, and she will have the possibility of sealing her file and having the case expunged after 10 years, he said. The case garnered attention as Hunt's lawyers claimed that authorities wouldn't have gone after her if the situation had involved a male and a female instead of two teenage girls. But after Thursday's court hearing, Workman said the case would have been no different if Kaitlyn was a boy. Hunt's parents have been critical of the victim's family for going to police over the relationship, repeating that criticism Thursday. \\\"If we start arresting kids for having sex or sexting, you might as well turn the high schools into prisons,\\\" they said. The victim's family released a statement saying it was never their intent to harm Hunt, and the case was never about gender or sexual orientation. \\\"It was about age-appropriate relationships and following the rules and laws of our society,\\\" the statement said. Hunt was 18 when she was charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after she was accused of having sexual relations with the girl, who was 14. In Florida, a person under the age of 16 is not legally able to consent to sex.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 96595,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The median wealth per adult in Australia is estimated to be $257,704 .\\nReal assets, comprising mainly of housing, were found to make up 60 per cent of household wealth in Australia .\\nAustralia was also found to have 4 per cent of the world's US dollar millionaires, with 1,252,000 people falling into the category .\\nThe data was reported in this year's annual Global Wealth Report\\u00a0by the Credit Suisse Group .\",\n          \"Barcelona star Lionel Messi has been playing on the wing to accommodate Luis Suarez's arrival .\\nMessi has scored seven league goals while Ronaldo has bagged 18 .\\nArsene Wenger insists Messi's morale will suffer if he falls further behind .\",\n          \"Sanders, 48, helped lead NFL team's investigation into player Ray Rice .\\nCourt records show he is charged with sex offense in fourth degree .\\nOffense covers non-violent assaults and carries up to a year in jail .\\nHis lawyer said last night the claims were 'totally fabricated, made up'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":23}],"source":["# Filtering the DataFrame without adding a new column to the filtered DataFrame\n","filtered_df = df[\n","    (df['article'].apply(count_tokens) <= 512) &\n","    (df['highlights'].apply(count_tokens) <= 150)\n","]\n","\n","# Display the filtered DataFrame\n","filtered_df\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728171991812,"user":{"displayName":"Solitary Solidary","userId":"05745463600367496889"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"4zsiYou3kaip","outputId":"cf081992-7bcb-46d3-ba5e-43a789bf8de3"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"summary":"{\n  \"name\": \"sample_filtered_df\",\n  \"rows\": 5000,\n  \"fields\": [\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"f7fe37025ac620adaf5a24e0d3c915e14d4437ac\",\n          \"65309b9498430ca22ebb416bb0e31f4658928e70\",\n          \"81ac6d22599cd1726e5e9da26369ee1b598023c5\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"article\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4997,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"(CNN) -- R&B legend Teddy Pendergrass died Wednesday evening, his former publicist said. He was 59. Pendergrass, known for smash love ballads such as \\\"Turn Off the Lights\\\" and \\\"Love TKO,\\\" died after a long illness, according to Lisa Barbaris, who described herself as a close friend and his last publicist. He died at a hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he was born. His family did not reveal details about his illness, but said it was related to complications from a 1982 car accident, Barbaris said. \\\"His beloved family surrounded him. The world has lost one of its greatest voices and performers,\\\" a statement from Barbaris said. \\\"His family is devastated. He has three children and, even though it was expected, it still hurts,\\\" she said. Gallery: The amazing Teddy Pendergrass . The crooner, who many affectionately knew as just \\\"Teddy,\\\" started in music with a group called the Cadillacs in the late 1960s and was still with the group when it merged with Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, according to his official Web site. He started as a drummer, but soon began to sing lead after the group heard his powerful voice. In 1972, Pendergrass's baritone could be heard on the classic Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes song \\\"If You Don't Know Me by Now.\\\" The song became a No. 1 hit across the country and led Pendergrass to many other hits and accolades. After going solo, Pendergrass received several Grammy nominations, Billboard's 1977 Pop Album New Artist Award and an American Music Award for best R&B performer of 1978, Barbaris said. In 1982, Pendergrass was involved in a car accident that left him paralyzed. But Pendergrass returned to the studio in 1984 in his wheelchair to record an album. Before his death, Pendergrass was working on a musical documenting his life, called \\\"I Am Who I Am.\\\"\",\n          \"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 11:57 EST, 15 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:31 EST, 15 November 2013 . Murder probe: Dr Gary Hughes was found dead at his home in Feock, and his wife Marion is believed to have been arrested . The wife of a GP has been arrested by police on suspicion of murder after her doctor husband was stabbed to death at their \\u00a3700,000 home. Gary Hughes, 60, was found dead in the coastal village of Feock, Cornwall, at 7.40am today and his wife Marion is believed to have been held by police. Officers said they found the body of a man with stab wounds to the chest and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. Mrs Hughes also suffered injuries and was taken to hospital but police said her wounds were not life threatening. Mr Hughes was a GP in the Camborne and Redruth area of Cornwall. Detective Inspector Ben Beckerleg of Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'This is the beginning of an investigation. 'But early indications suggest this was a domestic incident and no-one else is being sought at this time. 'An investigation had now begun to fully understand the circumstances and events leading up to this man's death.' Neighbour, Chris Young, said: 'When it comes so close to your doorstep it is very worrying. This is a very quiet area with very few passers-by.' Villager Cynthia Vanstone said: 'He was a lovely doctor. He was willing to help anyone'. Dr Hughes, qualified in 1977, was a Senior Partner at the Clinton Road NHS surgery in Redruth, Cornwall. The surgery's website lists his interests are obstetrics and family planning and said in his spare time he liked to go sailing. Probe: Police have sealed off Dr Hughes' property in Feock, Cornwall, where he was found with stab wounds . Dr Hughes, who had two sons, had continued a proud family tradition by following both his parents to become a GP. His late mother treated the survivors of the infamous Belsen concentration camp at the end of World War II. Dr June Hughes, who died in February last year at the age of 91, started her medical training in 1939 and was called up to serve as an Army doctor in 1944. After the war she became one of the first female doctors in Cornwall and married fellow GP Edward Hughes. They both worked as family doctors in picturesque villages around Truro from Chacewater to Feock. Gary, who was known to the family as 'Tiger', was their only son but her and his wife had six daughters: Rona, Anne, Jessica, Marion, Norna and Nina. The family home at Feock was used as a medical practice from 1962 and Dr Hughes and her husband carried out weekly surgeries in nearby St Day and Ponsanooth.

As part of its development phase, three schools across the nation will be chosen to trial the program which is set to be launched by 2015. If the program is successful it will be implemented nationally in government, Catholic and independent schools. A curriculum on child brides for Australian schools is being developed and will be launched by 2015. Three Australian schools will trial the program before it is implemented nationally . The Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans has been granted more than $60,000 to fund the pilot program and is working with the federal Attorney-General's Department to develop the curriculum. Justice Minister Michael Keenan told the Daily Telegraph that the Australian Federal Police have investigated more than 450 allegations of trafficking and slavery-related offences, with more than 230 victims identified. A spokeswoman for the Attorney-General's Department told Daily Mail Australia that ACRATH will engage with students and staff - including school councils, parents associations, teachers, counselling staff - at three pilot schools in at least three states. The initial stage of the project will involve 'workshops with pilot groups of teachers to develop materials pitched at junior secondary students, senior secondary students and parents'. 'In the longer-term, these materials are expected to be made available to secondary school students in government and independent schools nation-wide,' the spokeswoman said. 'ACRATH will also facilitate broader teacher training sessions on forced marriage.' The spokeswoman said the program aims to raise awareness about child brides being forced into matrimony in Australia. 'The purpose of the project is to improve the provision of education, awareness-raising and advice to people at risk of forced marriage, to support the prevention and detection of this crime and promote early intervention.' Funding of $350,000 has also been granted to Anti-Slavery Australia which is said to go towards creating website, providing legal advice and an assistance service for potential child brides. Earlier this year, the NSW father of 12-year-old girl was charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14. Police said the young girl's father, 61, facilitated the sexual assault of his daughter by actively arranging the unlawful marriage in NSW in January 2014 by allowing the pair to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before an Islamic ceremony took place in the living room. The father allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'. The 26-year-old Lebanese man, who has had his student visa cancelled and been placed in immigration detention, was charged with 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14 years. The case is currently before the court.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4985,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Duncan\\u00a0Ferguson\\u00a0involved\\u00a0in a car crash on the motorway near\\u00a0Liverpool .\\nThe Scottish coach refused to go to hospital for treatment .\\nNeither driver is thought to have been seriously injured in the crash .\\nFerguson spent 10 years at Everton over two different spells .\",\n          \"San Diego street gang ran prostitution ring across 46 cities in 23 states .\\nWomen and girls were promised a luxury life but instead treated like slaves .\\n24 San Diego residents have been arrested, most in raids across U.S.\",\n          \"Sobelman's Pub and Grill create the\\u00a0'Chicken Fried Bloody Beast'\\nIncludes four regular Bloody Marys and 14 other garnishes .\\nFeatures two 'Baconadoes' - bacon-wrapped jalape\\u00f1o cheeseballs .\\nThe cocktail feeds four and costs $50 .\\nA Milwaukee food charity gets $5 from every one sold .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"sample_filtered_df"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-97a07f65-e98f-455f-8712-949ef48309d0\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>article</th>\n","      <th>highlights</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>203154</th>\n","      <td>930221ca15ad24fa0b9a9d9d4e799f8afa320c98</td>\n","      <td>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan has inde...</td>\n","      <td>NEW: NATO force expects no impact on ability t...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>14124</th>\n","      <td>2813679140cb69776e64ee9d87ffa12c82a7394a</td>\n","      <td>Wonderful moments  in life can come at the mos...</td>\n","      <td>Homeless man was filmed playing the public pia...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>78669</th>\n","      <td>dee351470f101ae014d080898b60ba56b09ba841</td>\n","      <td>A Michigan man is celebrating the return of hi...</td>\n","      <td>Robert Cortis of Farmington Hills said he was ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>74900</th>\n","      <td>d4583b8aafd1f94e88f76fbe6a63354c51938ada</td>\n","      <td>By .

The Jerdon's Babbler (chrysomma altirostre altirostre) - a small brown bird similar in size to a house sparrow - was last spotted in Myanmar in 1941 and was thought to have died out altogether. But a team of scientists managed to uncover multiple birds nesting in a small area of grassland in Myanmar's central Bago region in May last year, according to their report published in the latest edition of Birding Asia. Re-discovered:\\u00a0The Jerdon's Babbler which was thought extinct for 73 years until scientists found evidence of it living in Burma . The scientists targeted some of the few remaining patches of wild grassland left along Myanmar's mighty Irrawaddy river, now one of the most heavily cultivated and densely populated regions of the impoverished but emerging southeast Asian nation. At one small patch of grassland near an abandoned agricultural station, the team heard what they thought could be the babbler's call. They then used a recording of a Jerdon's Babbler from the Indian subcontinent to see if the bird would show itself. Frank Rheindt, from the National University of Singapore, told AFP he was the first person to spot the bird during the survey, which was also carried out with members of the Wildlife Conservation Society and Myanmar's Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division. 'It was unbelievable,' he recalled. 'We played the sound recordings and one of the birds came up from the reed beds. Like many song birds in reed beds you hardly ever see them, they only come out to defend their territory when they hear a territorial call.' Further searches over the next two days uncovered more birds allowing researchers to obtain blood samples and photographs. But researchers warned that the bird's survival is still far from guaranteed given pressure on Myanmar's few remaining grasslands. 'This discovery not only proves that the species still exists in Myanmar but that the habitat can still be found as well,' Colin Poole, director of Wildlife Conservation Society's regional hub in Singapore, said in a statement. 'Future work is needed to identify remaining pockets of natural grassland and develop systems for local communities to conserve and benefit from them,' he added. Birds fly over the Moe Yun Gyi Wetlands in Bago Division, Myanmar, where\\u00a0Jerdon's Babbler was re-discovered 73 years after it was believed to be extinct . Rheindt said the area of grassland where the bird was found was very small, 'around 50-80 hectares' and that new chicken and fish farms were being built nearby. He added that its plumage and song were significantly different to how it had been described by ornithologists in the early twentieth century - leading the team to suspect that it may differ from threatened populations found in Nepal, India and Pakistan. His team now hope to conduct DNA tests to decide if it is a separate species. Burma's quasi-civilian government replaced decades of brutal military rule in 2011. It has since embarked on a series of political reforms and shown itself to be far more open to foreign businesses and academic researchers than the country's generals were. Burma has more species of bird than any other country in mainland Southeast Asia, with ornithologists saying this number is could increase if more scientific research is conducted.\",\n          \"A Sydney pastor has spoken about the incredible moment Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan offered a vital piece of himself in a bid to save the man's life. Mal Feebrey, a men's mental health ambassador, had been diagnosed with terminal liver disease in 2010, when the death row inmate, with whom he had formed a close friendship, offered his own liver up for transplant. Chan, who had been in jail for five years at the time, 'knocked' the Assemblies of God minister about when he heard of his friends plight and immediately said, 'have mine'. Scroll down for video . Mal Feebrey (above left), a men's mental health ambassador, had been diagnosed with terminal liver disease in 2010, when Bali Nine kingpin Andrew Chan (above right), with whom he had formed a close friendship, offered his own liver up for transplant . 'It really touched me. Here I am waiting for a donor, I'm dying in front of my wife and kids and here he is going \\\"my liver's ok, you can have mine\\\",' Mr Feebrey told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'He was sort of like, if they want to kill me, then you can have my liver. It wasn't a passing-the-time comment, he wanted to make it happen. If he could have pulled it off he would have,' he said. Chan reportedly began making enquiries about whether the organ donation could go ahead, determined to save Mr Feebrey, who shared his Christian faith and had been a regular visitor since his incarceration in 2005. While Mr Feebrey received a liver from another organ donor, he said that the gesture was unforgettable and was characteristic of his 'incredible' friend. Chan and fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran are currently being held on Nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency. Mr Feebrey said that when Chan heard the news that his appeal for clemency from Indonesian President Joko Widodo, he was more concerned with the health of a fellow inmate who was in the jail's clinic than himself. 'It was a bit surreal. Andrew took it on the chin and with courage and then he just walked off to go to the clinic to go and see this guy,' Mr Feebrey said . While Mr Feebrey received a liver from another organ donor, he said that the gesture was unforgettable and was characteristic of his 'incredible' friend . The pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two Australians . Chan and fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran are currently being held on Nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency . Mr Feebrey has continued to be in regular contact with Chan, and is an outspoken advocate for the 'I Stand For Mercy Campaign'. The pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two Australians, and posted on his Instagram account after the Chan heard of his rejected Clemency appeal. 'Just spent the last half an hour with my friend Andrew Chan, when the Australian Consulate Staff notified him that his final appeal against [the] death sentence was rejected,' Mr Feebrey posted. 'He took it on the chin with courage, humility and with a contrite heart.' In February, the pastor posted a 'message of hope' to supporters of Chan on his Instagram account. 'The most beautiful people that I've known are those that have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss and yet found a way out of these depths,' he posted underneath a photograph of himself with Chan. In February, the pastor posted a 'message of hope' to supporters of Chan on his Instagram account . The men's mental health ambassador said it would be tragic for Chan and Sukumaran, who have worked tirelessly to mentor other prisoners, to be executed. 'Andrew is the idyllic, dream guy to mentor and rehabilitate and a great seed like him \\u2013 they want to put to death?,' Mr Feebrey asked. Both Chan and Sukumaran have been involved in running education and drug rehabilitation programs inside Kerobokan prison since 2009. New footage has emerged of Sukumaran, shot as a part of a documentary in May last year, of Sukumaran discussing his hopes for the future before his bid for clemency was rejected. 'I think I can do a lot of good on the outside if I ever got free. It's not like I'm just going to go back after all this and just sit and be somewhere,' reported 9news. 'I would want to do stuff like work and make good stuff and help people,' he told Norwegian educator Ivar Schou, who met the Australian while running rehabilitation programs inside the prison. Sukumaran, who now faces the death penalty along with fellow inmate Andrew Chan, said that he believed he had done wrong but that he felt his punishment was too harsh. 'I accept what I did was wrong and I think I should be punished for it,' he said. The pair may be waiting months for their execution as other prisoners pursue lengthy appeals . Myuran Sukumaran, left, and Andrew Chan, right, will be put through an 'assimilation' process as they prepare to face the firing squad . 'But I do think the death penalty is too excessive.' Sukumaran was convicted in 2005 after attempting to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia. He has called Kerobokan prison in Bali his home for the past ten years, along with Chan. Sukumaran describes the immense change that he has seen in his life over the past ten years, most notably when he and other inmates were allowed to start education. 'In 2009 they finally gave us permission to start working and doing some projects. Slowly slowly it helped me with my life. It kept me busy. It helped me be productive. I started learning and I was able to help other people learning.' Earlier on Saturday the Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo said that the pair could have their executions delayed for months as other death row inmates take on lengthy court appeals. President Widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores . Mr Sukumaran was a highly respected art teacher while he was detained in Kerobokan prison . Mr Praseyto said the execution of the Bali nine duo will take place at the same time as several other foreigners on death row. This could delay the pair's execution as all avenues of legal appeal for the other eight convicted drug offenders must be exhausted before their death sentence can be carried out. The Australian government, alongside several notable public figures, have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has written to the Indonesia government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions. Ms Bishop is yet to receive a response.\",\n          \"Everton boss Roberto Martinez feels the poor condition of the pitch at Dynamo Kiev's Olympic Stadium is 'a concern' - but he is sure it will be just as problematic for one side as the other in Thursday's Europa League last-16 second-leg encounter.

But flying an Ebola patient halfway around the world -- while keeping that person alive, and everyone safe -- is complicated. Probably no one knows that better than Phoenix Air, a Georgia-based company that is the go-to for transporting Ebola victims by air. Since August, it has made approximately 40 trips -- about half to Europe, the rest to the United States. \\\"We're like a fire truck sitting in the firehouse. The bell goes off and within a matter of hours we can be out the door and underway,\\\" said Dent Thompson, vice president and chief operations officer at Phoenix Air. He described the system that goes inside the company's modified Gulfstream G-III aircraft. It consists of three major elements: . Once the plane has landed and the patient has left, the whole system is sealed. The aircraft then flies to a high-security hanger in Cartersville, Georgia, where it undergoes a complete decontamination process, which can take up to 24 hours. Everything inside the liner, including the liner, is sterilized multiple times. The liner and everything in it is then removed, put in special boxes, and taken to a federally licensed incinerator where everything is destroyed. \\\"We like to say it's more sterile than the surface of the moon when we're done with it,\\\" Thompson said. Phoenix Air began developing its system way before the current Ebola outbreak. It worked with the Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to build a system that could safety transport patients with contagious diseases. Then, the main concerns were SARS, swine and bird flu. It took years to work out the kinks and get the system approved, and by the time the work was done, the need had sort of petered out. But Thompson said Phoenix Air held onto the system, knowing -- unfortunately -- the need would arise again. He got a call from the State Department in July. By August, the company had completed its first Ebola flight, safely delivering Dr. Kent Brantly to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. A few days later, it brought Nancy Writebol to the same hospital for treatment. And on and on and on. Thompson said other groups are now developing systems similar to Phoenix Air's, including the U.S. government. But so far, none has flown. \\\"Other organizations have built systems, but we're the ones still doing it,\\\" he said. More than 10,000 people have died in the Ebola outbreak, mostly in the countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\",\n          \"Louis van Gaal ended his post-match press conference on a prickly note after being asked about the failings of Manchester United's on loan striker Radamel Falcao. Falcao was left as an unused substitute as United pressed for an equaliser in their FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, but Van Gaal was quick to defend his forward. The Dutch manager interrupted a journalist asking about the striker to defend his forward's record, and hit out at the press for enjoying the Colombian's dismal record, before ending with a sarcastic remark. Louis van Gaal (left) trudges away after the defeat, with Radamel Falcao (right) walking ahead of him . Van Gaal was in a bad mood at the press conference, pointing accusingly at a journalist for the question . As he left the room the Dutchman sarcastically remarked 'very good question', and gave a thumbs up . The United boss decided not to use Falcao despite chasing an equaliser, keeping the expensive star benched . 'He scored four goals and has 3 or 4 assists, so that is his contribution,' said a clearly annoyed Van Gaal. 'And he stimulates also the other players, so that's also an aspect of the profession.' 'But it is now easy for you to say that (criticism of Falcao), and that's why you are saying that. And you are very happy to say that, I see that in your face.' When the journalist then pointed out that four goals is not very much for a striker on \\u00a3280,000 a week, Van Gaal seemed to agree, but continued to take issue with the line of questioning. The 63-year-old took issue with the line of inquiry about Falcao, interrupting a journalist's question . Falcao has scored four goals since joining on loan, a meagre return for \\u00a3280,000 per week . Van Gaal issues tactical instructions during the game, but was unable to stem the tide against Arsenal . 'Yes,' he responded. 'I cannot change that. I cannot change facts, and you know that. But you can continue.' The United boss then called an end to his press conference, before leaving with a sarcastic jibe of 'very good question' to the offending journalist, and giving him the thumbs up.\",\n          \"Forget switchblades it's shears that will be the new weapon of choice for members of New Zealand's notorious Mongrel Mob and Black Power gangs who are set to take up a new community initiative. The New Zealand Herald\\u00a0reports that in July the council of Dunedin City, on the South Island's east coast, will begin an initial programme where the two gangs can apply for basic community work - such as mowing lawns, trimming hedges, and cutting back foliage. Both the Mongrel Mob and Black Power have shared a violent rivalry spanning decades. The gangs have been involved in drug trafficking, alleged murder, and robbery - but last year the gangs surprised everyone by suddenly making peace, not war. The council of Dunedin City, on New Zealand's South Island, will begin an initial programme where the two gangs can apply for basic community work . It's a very different kind of work than they're used to, but the gangs have joined forces in a submission to the Dunedin City Council, asking for help in acquiring paid work to support their families. 'It's remarkable they're working together. They've had a long history of just shooting each other,' Dunedin Mayor Dave Cull said. 'But I think they're both beginning to realise that violence won't provide them much of a future anymore.' Rather than shoot and knife each other the proposal was put forward for them to work together as an employment solution for gang members who were struggling to support their families, and steer them from a life of crime. The Mongrel Mob and Black Power gangs have been involved in drug trafficking, alleged murder and robbery . Mayor Cull explained that as the men approach middle age they've found their reputation and appearance have prevented them from finding traditional and regular employment. In response to concerns that work is being spoon-fed to gang members and that there are others more deserving of the chance, the Dunedin City Council said it will ensure that both Mongrel Mob and Black Power have to meet standard expectations. This includes meeting state health and safety requirements and providing insurance cover like any other commercial landscaping company.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

Wu Jiayong, 46, became an internet hit after he produced the electric rice cooker from his luggage and made his own lunch in the middle of Hong Kong's busy International Airport. The 46-year-old was caught on camera collecting water from the airport's bathroom before plugging the rice cooker into one of the lounge's empty sockets, according to The People's Daily. Wu Jiayong, 46, became an internet sensation after he produced an electric rice cooker from his luggage and started to prepare his lunch in the middle of Hong Kong International Airport . The construction worker was flying home to Shandong, China, after losing his job in Singapore when he fell asleep and missed his connecting flight. 'I had just enough to get a new ticket set to leave on Tuesday two days later, but I didn't have any more money for food,' he said. 'I didn't want to offend anyone but I needed power supply to cook the rice so I had to do it indoors.' Eyewitnesses described the rice cooker as being 'hard to miss' with steam coming from it for over half an hour. After missing his flight the construction worker was left with no money for food and decided to make his own meals . Shocked eye witnesses took pictures after seeing the Mr\\u00a0Jiayong start cooking in the middle of the departure terminal . Mr Jiayong's mini kitchen was soon closed down by airport officials, but fellow travellers and stores within the terminal  helped him with food until he was able to fly home yesterday. He had been forced to travel to Singapore for work to help look after his family and used the rice cooker for preparing meals during his month long employment. Mr Jiayong was soon stopped from tapping into the airports electricity supply, but fellow travellers and terminal stores kept him fed after learning of his plight .\",\n          \"A chicken which nearly died after it was savaged by a fox has recovered thanks to an innovative form of bird physiotherapy. Seven-year-old Rosie was attacked in the back garden of her owner Jean Hull, and vets said she was 'almost split in two' following her ordeal. Mrs Hull resolved to do all she could to save the bird's life, because she was the favourite pet of her late husband Maurice, and spent five months nursing her back to health. Scroll down for video . Injured: Rosie the chicken was attacked by a fox in her owner's garden in Sussex last November . Rosie underwent a pioneering physio procedure which involved her limbs being carefully manipulated and exercises to build up her strength. Mrs Hull, from High Salvington in Sussex, said: 'She clearly wanted to live and wasn't going to let that fox beat her. 'She was my late husband's favourite, so that is where the extra feeling comes from. She is a little bit of him.' The couple bought Rosie and another hen in 2008 because they could not find eggs which were both fresh and organic. But in November last year, she was suddenly grabbed by a fox while she was running free in the garden. Treatment: Rosie has since undergone a new form of avian physiotherapy to help her recover . Stretches: The treatment involves manipulating her limbs to enable her to walk normally again . Mrs Hull said: 'This fox came whizzing down the garden and grabbed her and dashed down the bottom of the garden. I screamed and I just had to try to stop the fox. 'Eventually, the fox did drop her and ran off but Rosie was just laying there bleeding and there were feathers everywhere.' Rosie was rushed to a nearby vet's office, where Tania Parsons carried out emergency surgery to save her. But as the chicken recovered she was having difficulty walking because of the scar tissue which had formed over her wounds. Hale and hearty: The physio has apparently been a success and Rosie is now back to full health . Ms Parsons said: 'Last year, Rosie came in almost split in two and had to have quite major surgery to stitch her back together. 'I had never heard of physiotherapy for chickens but she responded to it really well. 'I've only seen it done on chickens on YouTube videos in America. Rosie is a very special hen and Jean looks after her very well.' Mrs Hull also took Rosie to a pet blessing service as church, which she says helped to speed her recovery.\",\n          \"Footage of a four-year-old boy firing a gun into the air has caused outrage in Mexico after video showing him firing wildly in the middle of the street was posted online. While Mexican laws allow residents to keep guns within their own homes, the boy can be seen firing the pistol repeatedly above his head while several adults stand around apparently unconcerned. Despite the fact that the gun recoils after each bullet, he is clearly well versed in using it and fires off several rounds. The boy can be seen standing in the middle of the street with the gun poised above his head . He then begins firing off rounds, while adults standing nearby appear completely unconcerned . The video caused outrage across Mexico after it was posted online and went viral . Police are now being urged to investigate both the child and the adults who appear in the video . The video has now gone viral with authorities being urged to track down the boy and adults, and take legal action. It is a common misconception that guns are illegal in Mexico but ownership is strictly controlled, with only licensed firearms allowed to be kept at home for reasons of personal protection. A police spokesman confirmed to local media that a child standing in the middle of the street firing a gun indiscriminately into the air was definitely not legal under any circumstances. He said: 'We have heard about the case including the allegation that happened in Mexico, but at the moment we have no more details.' He added that if anybody knew any more details including the location and the names of the three adults who also appeared in the video then they should contact police and pass it on. The video shocked many in a country that is used to gun violence. Virgo Tierra wrote: 'How awful, those are the values that children are taught it seems.' And another, Alfredo Taquillo, said: 'I guess in a few years when he has killed somebody his parents will say he must have got in with bad company.'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York . 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation . Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, \\\"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\\\".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'\",\n          \"Eerie footage has emerged showing a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO. The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the  cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace. The video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to YouTube, prompting all manner of bizarre explanations for the\\u00a0phenomenon - with many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra-terrestrial life. Spine-chilling: The creepy footage shows a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO . Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared. Once the cloud had rapidly dispersed, no trace of it was left in the sky. Speaking to local news website Today.kz, villager Oleg Menshikov said: 'It was like a black cloud. We saw it at around 4 pm on April 3. It dissipated like smoke, but it was completely odourless.' Within minutes of the video being shared online, YouTube users began to question whether the thick black hoop was an alien spacecraft, while others suggested it might just be cigarette smoke immediately in front of the camera but giving the perception it is in the sky. Others thought the cloud was likely to be a naturally occurring weather event known as a thermal microburst, which is caused by a falling mass of warm air. Mysterious: The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace . Dispersing rapidly: Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . Experts believe the cloud was roughly 100 metres in diameter and floated close to a mile in the air. Speaking to Russia Today, Andrey Solodovnik - associate physics professor at the Northern Kazakhstan State University - dismissed suggestions the cloud was caused by aliens. He said that based on similar clouds seen in the skies in recent years, the giant black hoop was likely to have been little more than a smoke ring generated by combustion at nearby factories. Plenty of industrial machinery is known to create ring-shaped clouds of smoke, though these are usually lighter-coloured, considerably less dense and vanish in just one or two minutes. In the latest instance it is likely the cloud was far more visible and hung around in the sky for much longer than usual for the simple reason it was cloudless day with little to no wind.\",\n          \"Arrested: Doug Hughes was put under arrest for his gyro-copter stunt and charged with\\u00a0operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace . The postal carrier who flew a gyrocopter onto the lawn of the U.S. Capitol is facing two criminal charges. But he's being released from federal custody to return to Florida. Doug Hughes made his initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Washington on Thursday. That's one day after he steered his tiny aircraft onto the Capitol's West Lawn after flying through restricted airspace around the National Mall. He was charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace. Hughes said it was a political protest. Hughes was released on his own recognizance afterward and instructed to check in weekly with authorities in Tampa starting next week. In a soft voice, Hughes appeared to ask the judge a clarifying question about that obligation but otherwise he did not say anything significant. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,'\\u00a0as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why. Johnson said it's too soon to say whether Wednesday's incident should prompt changes in security procedures. 'I want to know all the facts before I reach an assessment of what can and should be done about gyrocopters in the future,' he said. But lawmakers said the incident exposed a gap in security, especially amid revelations that the pilot, Florida postal worker Doug Hughes, was interviewed by the Secret Service almost two years ago. The agency apparently determined he did not pose a threat, said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Cummings spoke Thursday with the Secret Service director. 'I think that there's absolutely a gap, and it's a very dangerous gap, with regard to our airspace,' Cummings said. 'I don't want people to get a message that they can just land anywhere. Suppose there was a bomb or an explosive device on that air vehicle? That could have been a major catastrophe.' How'd it happen? Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why . Approach: The small gyro-copter (circled in red) lands on the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington as members of the public walk by. The stunt hasn't cost him his freedom, yet, but means he must check in with authorities every week as he awaits trial . Johnson said the Secret Service passed along the information from the interview with Hughes, who was to appear in court Thursday afternoon, to 'all of the appropriate law enforcement agencies.' House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the incident 'stunning.' 'What safeguards can we use? We don't want to be a place where we're saying `This is an iron-clad Capitol.' And have such restrictions on people having access to it,' Pelosi told reporters. 'Nonetheless, we have to ensure the safety of those people.' The tiny, open-air aircraft landed without injuries to anyone, but the incident raises questions about how someone could be allowed to fly all the way from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, right up to the Capitol. Hughes has said he was making the flight to publicize his concerns about the corrupting influence of money in politics, and deliver letters to all 535 members of Congress on the topic. 'We are a democracy. We don't have fences around our airspace, so we've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society and security and the protection of federal buildings,' Johnson told reporters on Capitol Hill. 'And so we want to stay one step ahead of every incident like this, but then again, you don't want to overreact, either.' Still, lawmakers questioned why, if authorities had been in touch with Hughes, no action was taken to stop him. Practice run: Doug Hughes flies his gyrocopter near the Wauchula Municipal Airport in Wauchula, Florida prior to his 'insane' stunt on Wednesday . Before\\u00a0Doug Hughes made headlines by flying his open air helicopter onto the U.S. Capitol grounds, he blogged about his intention to undertake the 'non-violent demonstration.' Though, it may have been a demonstration years in the making. In a post dated September 2013 on the democracyclub.org, a writer called Tampadoug47 wrote: . Let me say first \\u2013 this is a non-violent demonstration. I have no intention of hurting anyone \\u2013 I have taken every precaution to prevent any injury to anyone, including me. There is no way I can prevent over-reaction by the authorities, but I have given them as much information and advance warning as my fuel supply allows. When I took off, I was over an hour away from the no-fly zone. The demonstration is about restoring democracy. Corruption in Washington DC has robbed the US citizens of the representative government that is our birthright. Polls show that the public is aware of the problem and VERY concerned, but they are largely uninformed that there is a solution and there are organizations prepared to make reform a reality. As a result of this flight, two things will happen. (I hope.) First, we\\u2019re going to change the narrative \\u2013 the story. Voters are going to quit being played like suckers with divisive hot-button issues and come together on a single issue. Honest government. Congress won\\u2019t start working for you or me when their big paycheck is from big business. Lobbyists, Special Interests, Unions. We have to make this happen. The political parties won\\u2019t. Congress sure won\\u2019t. Lobbyists love the status quo. The mainstream media (not the local media) is making a financial killing with mega-elections. It\\u2019s up to us. Second, in every Congressional race in 2016, I want every candidate to take a stand on corruption. After this flight, we\\u2019re going to define exactly what reform means \\u2013 set a written standard \\u2013 and it\\u2019s that standard which candidates will have to endorse. Or the candidate will have to defend to voters why he took a lesser position. The candidate who only wants to talk \\u2018reform\\u2019 but won\\u2019t endorse the real deal will be facing someone who will endorse real reform. That may be in the primary or the general election. Giving you a choice is our job. The clear choice, establishment or reform, will be in place in just a year for just over 460 congressional races. You get to choose (That\\u2019s your job as a voter.) but for the first time in decades, you will have a meaningful choice. What do I want from you? Look over your options on the previous screen or the \\u2018Honor Roll\\u2019 on the sidebar to the right. Rootstrikers or Wolf PAC or Represent.US. My favorite group isn\\u2019t listed there \\u2013 it\\u2019s my own startup group:\\u2018The Civilist Papers\\u2018. Find a group (or groups) that you are comfortable with and sign up. We\\u2019re not after money \\u2013 we want to know who you are and where you are so we can keep you informed. Protest flight: Doug Hughes took off from an undisclosed location in Washington D.C. and landed his gyro-copter on the West Front lawn of the US Capitol building . 'My concerns are the prior notice that he was going to do this and the lack of response,' said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. 'These small aircraft or UAV devices concern me because they could go undetected and cause damage, so that's something we're taking a look at,' McCaul said, adding he might hold hearings on the issue. Cummings and others also complained that they were not notified of the incident and that many first learned of it from the news media. Johnson defended existing protocols for dealing with the restricted airspace over Washington, D.C., federal buildings and monuments. 'We've got a well-coordinated federal response to dealing with issues of those who penetrate the restricted airspace without permission,' he said. He said his first reaction on hearing of the incident was to ask, 'What's a gyrocopter?' It's not unusual for a small aircraft like a gyrocopter to go undetected by conventional radar. Unlike most larger aircraft, a gyrocopter doesn't have a transponder that identifies the aircraft, its altitude and heading. Even without a transponder, radar can detect 'primary targets' - planes, flocks of birds, rain and other objects. But how well it can detect those objects depends upon several factors. The landing on the Capitol grounds 'just illustrates how hard it is to have an impermeable barrier. It's very hard to hermetically seal airspace,' said John Hansman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics professor.

The veteran Scot recovered from losing the opening frame to move 4-2 ahead, but both players were struggling for rhythm in Beijing. Trump narrowed the gap and a break of 68 helped the UK Championship finalist take the match to a decider, where Higgins prevailed, after overturning a 59-point deficit. John Higgins moved into the quarter finals of the China Open with a 5-4 victory over Judd Trump . Trump had a 59 point lead in the deciding frame before being dumped out by the veteran Scotsman . His reward will be a clash with world No 4 Ding, who dispatched two-time world champion Mark Williams 5-2. The Chinese took the initiative in the opening frame with a 68 and from then on never looked back, winning the last two frames with Williams failing to pot a single ball. World champion Mark Selby was also a 5-2 winner over David Gilbert in a low-quality clash and the world No 1 will next face Robert Milkins, who thrashed Michael White 5-1, which included four breaks over 50. Masters champion Shaun Murphy was in fine form against Jamie Jones, whose late rally counted for nothing in a 5-3 defeat. Higgins will face defending champion and local favourite Ding Junhui in the last eight in Beijing . World No 1 Mark Selby moved into the quarter finals with a routine win over David Gilbert . After losing the opening frame, Murphy bounced backs and breaks of 67, 143 and 80 helped him move 4-1 ahead, and although Jones came within one frame of levelling, the world number eight prevailed. Murphy will play Kurt Maflin in the last eight after the English-Norwegian player cruised to a 5-1 victory over Robin Hull. Breaks of 76, 87, 51 and 79 helped Barry Hawkins to a 5-3 triumph over Stephen Maguire and a clash with Gary Wilson, a convincing 5-1 winner over Dechawat Poomjaeng.\",\n          \"Rafa Benitez has admitted he tried to raid former club Chelsea to sign Andre Schurrle before the midfielder joined Wolfsburg in January.

Napoli travel to Wolfsburg for the first leg of the quarter-final and Benitez also added that his team had more character than his Europa League winning Chelsea team, as well as his Liverpool outfit who won the Champions League in 2005 .

Raymond Howell Jr.'s body was found near a culvert alongside a busy road in McKinney, Texas - around four miles from where he attended school at\\u00a0McKinney Boyd High - on Thursday. Police, who were on the scene at 7am, have not confirmed how he passed away but friends on social media reported that he had died from a bullet wound. After his body was found, friends said that he never would have taken his life, but McKinney police confirmed on Thursday that it was suicide. Loss: The body of Raymond Howell, Jr. was found early on Thursday morning a few miles from his school . Tribute: Friends paid tribute to the teenager on social media. Some friends reported that he had been bullied . Friends recalled him as a happy and friendly teenager, but said he had recently asked for a transfer after being bullied by older students, CBS reported. 'There were people who didn't like him, but it's life - there's always someone that won't like you,' family friend Aleena Rogers, 16, told the\\u00a0Dallas Morning News. 'But those were very few and far between for him. He was loved by most everyone.' She said he was always helping other people and called him 'an amazing guy with a huge heart'. Another friend wrote on Instagram that Howell had been found shot to death and called him 'a great, happy, awesome, and nice guy'. 'I am gonna miss you bro,' he wrote. School district officials have not yet responded to requests from DailyMail.com over whether they were aware of the bullying claims. Scene: His body was found near this culvert in McKinney, Texas. Friends say he died of a bullet wound . School: He was a freshman at McKinney Boyd High, pictured, but had reportedly asked for a transfer . Loved: Another friend posted pictures to Twitter showing him with Raymond when they were younger . But they released a statement on Thursday to say they would be providing counselors to help students and staff affected by the tragedy. 'It is with great sadness that we were informed this morning of the death of a McKinney Boyd High School student,' district spokesman Cody Cunningham said in the statement.

Mr Rickard, a retired industrial engineer, said: \\u2018Daisy was off the lead and she just slipped off the side. She was swimming okay but the current was taking her away and eventually she got so weak and gave up. \\u2018Her head went under the water, it was horrendous.\\u2019 Daisy was pulled from the water by a passing fisherman on a boat who hooked a pole through her collar. The family were on holiday in Caernarfon, North Wales, pictured, when the drama unfolded . Mr Rickard said: \\u2018He handed her to me. She was just totally motionless, there was nothing there. I started rubbing her chest and there was lots of water coming out of her mouth and nostrils. Daisy has now recovered from the ordeal . \\u2018I instinctively started breathing in her mouth and after about four or five minutes of me and my wife doing it I put my cheek to her nose and could feel a slight breath. \\u2018We wrapped her up as warm as we could and drove to the vet. In the car I treated her as if she was a human and kept calling her name and trying to keep her with us and to keep her eyes open.\\u2019 He said the vet put Daisy on oxygen and kept her in overnight. \\u2018They said she might have pneumonia or brain damage but she pulled through,\\u2019 he added. \\u2018She doesn\\u2019t seem to have been affected at all.\\u2019 The couple, from Rugby, Warwickshire, had been on holiday with their family in Caernarfon, North Wales, with their daughter Karen, 36, and two grandchildren. The couple\\u2019s daughter, who witnessed the rescue said her parents had performed a miracle. She said: \\u2018We were all crying and screaming because Daisy had drowned. \\u2018My folks got to work quickly, pressing her chest and giving her mouth-to-mouth. We couldn\\u2019t believe it when her eyes opened.\\u2019\",\n          \"Two Islamic teachers will stand trial accused of repeatedly beating a ten-year-old boy - for wrongly reciting the Koran.

Following a segment on wedding costs that touched on the price of engagement rings,\\u00a0WCCO This Morning reporter Ashley Roberts' boyfriend, Justin McCray, surprised her with an engagement ring of her own. And it was a good news day for everyone involved \\u2014 Ashley said yes. Scroll down for video. She said yes! Reporter Ashley Roberts was surprised on air during Minnesota's This Morning show by a proposal from her boyfriend Justin McCray (pictured together) Romantic plan: Ashley's co-workers helped arrange for her boyfriend to come out after an on-air discussion about engagement rings . To her surprise, it seems Ashley's This Morning co-workers were in on the plan all along; while wrapping up the wedding segment, anchor Jason DeRush noted that men spend an average of $5,855 on the engagement ring. 'Guys are under a lot of pressure to treat the woman to a nice big rock,' Ashley, who is originally from Florida, responded. The anchors then introduced a 'fashion expert' to talk more about rings \\u2014\\u00a0but the expert turned out to be none other than Ashley's boyfriend Justin. Surprise appearance: Ashley was nearly speechless upon seeing her boyfriend, repeating 'oh my god, oh my god' while Justin knelt down in front of her . 'I want to spend the rest of my life with you,' Justin told her, before getting down on one knee and presenting her with a ring. 'Now Jason,' he added, turning to the show's anchor, 'you were talking about [the cost of] rings, and I promise you \\u2014 a brother pretty broke.' Luckily, Ashley seemed far from disappointed with her rock; the reporter repeated 'Oh my god, oh my god' before flashing her new ring for her co-workers, exclaiming: 'I'm engaged!' Happy ending: She can be seen in the video excitedly telling her co-workers 'I'm engaged!' Before the camera cut away, Ashley realized the whole wedding piece was for her benefit, asking: 'So wait, is this why we're doing the wedding segment?' Not that she minded doing the work. 'Best surprise of my life,' she wrote on Twitter later that day. 'I get to spend the rest of my life with my best friend.

This year’s conference comes at a critical juncture, with global temperatures rising and extreme weather events becoming more frequent and intense. In the lead-up to COP28, countries are under pressure to make significant commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement. The scientific community has been vocal about the need for urgent action, highlighting that without drastic changes, the consequences for ecosystems, human health, and economies could be catastrophic. The conference will bring together world leaders, negotiators, scientists, and activists, all aiming to forge a consensus on climate action. Key topics on the agenda include transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing carbon capture technologies, and addressing the loss and damage faced by vulnerable nations affected by climate change. Many countries have already made pledges to cut emissions, but the gap between commitments and actual reductions remains a significant concern. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that while some progress has been made, it is not enough to avert the worst impacts of climate change. To close this gap, governments are being urged to enhance their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and consider more ambitious targets. Civil society organizations are mobilizing ahead of COP28, demanding that governments prioritize climate justice and equity. Activists emphasize the importance of involving indigenous communities and marginalized groups in decision-making processes, as they are often the most affected by climate change. The conference will also feature discussions on climate finance, with developed nations being urged to fulfill their commitment of providing $100 billion annually to support developing countries in their climate efforts. As the date approaches, the stakes have never been higher, and the world will be watching to see if COP28 can deliver the necessary commitments to combat climate change effectively.\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":863,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728173493620,"user":{"displayName":"Solitary Solidary","userId":"05745463600367496889"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"PHXqtTQEp4Bw","outputId":"2470c989-f235-4dc2-868f-2769a35f06a1"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Generated summary: The 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference is scheduled to take place in Dubai from November 30 to\n"]}],"source":["# Tokenize the input text\n","inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512)\n","\n","# Move the tensors to GPU if available\n","if torch.cuda.is_available():\n","   inputs = {key: value.to('cuda') for key, value in inputs.items()}\n","\n","# Generate the output\n","with torch.no_grad():  # Disable gradient calculation\n","    output_ids = model.generate(**inputs)\n","\n","# Decode the output\n","output_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n","\n","print(\"Generated summary:\", output_text)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aM6ghzENMYwX"},"source":["Comment on Model Output:\n","\n","The model produced an incomplete response regarding the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference, scheduled to take place in Dubai from November 30.
